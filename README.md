# Appwrite Function: `get-recent-activity`

## 1. Purpose

This is an on-demand, HTTP-triggered function that provides a unified and accurately sorted list of the most recent activities across multiple database collections.

The admin dashboard needs to show a feed of "what just happened," regardless of whether it was a new user signing up, a teacher uploading a note, or a new link being added. Fetching the last 2-3 items from each collection on the client-side is inefficient and inaccurateâ€”the 3rd most recent note could be older than the 10th most recent user.

This function solves the problem by fetching a larger pool of recent items from all relevant collections on the server, merging them into a single list, sorting them by their creation date, and returning the *truly* most recent items overall.

## 2. Trigger

This function is designed to be executed via a **GET HTTP Request**.

Your frontend application (e.g., a Next.js Server Action) should call this function's endpoint to get the activity feed data whenever the dashboard is loaded.
